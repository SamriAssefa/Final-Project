        <header><h2>How to get started</h2></header>
        <p> Things you need to get started.
            First, you need your music. You can either record at home or in a professional studio. 
            As long as you have good quality music it doesn't matter where you make it.
            Second, you need to know your target audience. In order to get to know your target demographic and what they care about,
            engage on your social media pages and see who is loving your music and engaging with your content.
            Third, Tell your story. Our story is the most powerful tool we have at our disposal. 
            This way your audience can relate to you and your music.
            Fourth, Study music marketing. This is a trail and error business. You won't know what people like until
            you engage with them. 
            Fifth, remember to stay true to yourself.

        <p> The best ways to market your music:
            First, Promote your work on social media. You should be active on all major social media platforms.
            Second, Run ads. You don't need to be good at this yet. Run ads to collect data that will give you a better idea
            of who your target audience is.
            Third, Build your mailing list. Your mailing list is your currency, social media platforms come and good, 
            but email is forever.
            Fourth, Create multiple sources of income. Physical copies of your album, merch, limited edition giveaways,
            lessons, backstage passes, signed items, & royalties.
